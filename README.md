# DebianScript
Bash Script for hardening Ubuntu and Debian linux distributions, installing major server functions, and configuring them.

**This script is provided as-is. Use it at your own risk. It has been tested thoroughly, but we can't
prepare for every possible issue or configuration.**

More functions will be added for end users as well, and for additional server features, creating a simple,
menu driven script to perform most major installation and configuration tasks with minimal user intervention and time required.

The script uses flag files to track which functions have been completed and what has been configured. 
This prevents it from running multiple instances of the same functions and causing configuration errors.

**This currently only supports Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS. Other distros will be supported soon.**

**USE:**

Either download from here and place the files where you would like them, or begin in the directory you wish to place them in. 
This script assumes you are logged in as a user with sudo privileges, you own the folder you're extracting it to,
and you will be prompted for your password when necessary. Do not run as root user or with sudo.

Change the version number for the first two commands to suit the version you wish to download from the available releases.
  
```
$ sudo mkdir /the-directory-you-want-to-keep-this-script-in

$ cd /the-directory-you-want-to-keep-this-script-in

$ sudo chown -R `whoami`:`whoami` ./

$ sudo chmod -R 770 ./

$ wget https://github.com/RentANerdConsulting/DebianScript/archive/1.1.2.tar.gz

$ tar --strip-components=2 -zxvf 1.1.2.tar.gz DebianScript-1.1.2/Bash/

$ sudo chown -R `whoami`:`whoami` ./

$ sudo chmod -R 770 ./

$ rm -R debian turnkey

$ ./LinuxUtility.sh
```  
The system will prompt for a reboot at least once. After reboot, cd to the script directory.
```
$ cd /directory-you-chose
  
$ ./LinuxUtility.sh
```
Once at the main menu, choose exit without reboot, then 
```
$ sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin ./
```
Once this is done, rerun the script and enjoy.
